IMMEDIATE TODOS:

- [ ] Position leaves
        - One leaf at end of each branch other than trunk - Griffin
        - More intelligently leaf positioning (coming! Soon!)
- [ ] Stochastically rotating branches - Katherine
- [ ] Toggling for different seasons, leaves disappearing in winter - Lucy
- [ ] Dropdown for different trees/snowflake? triangle? ! - Griffin
- [ ] Separate shader for leaves and branches - Katherine
- [ ] Quick video - For Monday - Katherine

NICE 2 HAVE
- [ ] Radial decay of branches
- [ ] Avoid collisions/intersections of branches
- [ ] Figure out how to use meshes instead of primitives (big maybe)
- [ ] Displacement mapping for wobbling tree
- [ ] Skybox - Katherine
- [ ] Terrain
- [ ] Lighting
- [ ] Particles for snow?
- [ ] Moving leaves (maybe fragment shader?)


- [x] Recursive function that takes in string, outputs list of mat4 transformations - Griffin
- [x] Rounded cylinder ends - Katherine
- [x] Leaves mesh - Katherine
- [x] Add Lucy's code to our branch - Griffin
