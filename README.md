IMMEDIATE TODOS:
- [ ] displacement mapping for the baby island - Katherine
- [ ] normal / displacement mapping for the tree - Griffin
- [ ] Lighting
- [ ] Position leaves - Potentially katherine after island
        - One leaf at end of each branch other than trunk
        - More intelligently leaf positioning (coming! Soon!)
- [ ] Quick video - For Monday - Katherine

NICE 2 HAVE
- [ ] Radial decay of branches
- [ ] Avoid collisions/intersections of branches
- [ ] Figure out how to use meshes instead of primitives (big maybe)
- [ ] Displacement mapping for wobbling tree
- [ ] Skybox - Katherine
- [ ] Lighting
- [ ] Particles for snow?
- [ ] Moving leaves (maybe fragment shader?)


- [x] Recursive function that takes in string, outputs list of mat4 transformations - Griffin

- [x] Add Lucy's code to our branch - Griffin
- [x] Stochastically rotating branches - Katherine
- [x] Toggling for different seasons, leaves disappearing in winter - Lucy
